Resources for the rapid web sessions

Hello everyone,
I am dedicating this channel to serve our communications through this intensive web development course.
While I hope each one of you will gain the maximum potential of this course and become a talented web developer, the minimum you will get is to discover the technical part of the internet and how it works, also learn how to solve everyday problems using softwares.
Because I've never teched a long term course before, I will try to collect the most exciting but useful material from everywhere and present it in fun and practical way so you guys keep motivated along the course.

What I expect you to learn through this is:
Level 0:
- How Internet in general works.
- How web pages are being created and how they are functioning.
- What is frontend, and what is backend.
- What is a web server and what it serves.

Level 1:
- Introduction to HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.
- Building actual websites and make them up and running.
- Deploy your work to web server.

Level 2:
- How software teams work together everyday.
- What is AGILE, SCRUM, Sprints,
- Introduction to GIT, and GitHub.
- Deploy your work to web server (By yourself).

Level 3:
- Build cool things Part 1. (Using Backend as a service)
- Build cool things Part 2. (Using Slack bots)
- Build cool things Part 3. (Unleash your power and build a feature for Yamsafer)

Through the course, I will continually set weekly/bi-weekly challenges to keep you attached to the concepts while building something useful.
We will be voting for those challenges, and assign collaborating groups for big ones.
We will accelerate and slow the course pace, adding and omitting stuff based on your inputs and learning curve.

There will be topics that I am not the best one to teach, so we'll invite speakers from yamsafer technical team every now and then.
And please remember, learning how to code, will widely open your mind to new perspectives of thinking.
Nothing to lose guys, you are really gaining superpowers to convert ideas to products. So make it your new year resolution.
